# KRIPTRACE

`kriptrace` is a Python-based IP and domain reconnaissance tool that runs in an interactive terminal interface.  
It gathers information such as location, ISP, organization, ASN, and live website status for a given IP address or domain name.

The tool uses the [ip-api.com](http://ip-api.com) API to fetch geolocation and network metadata.
